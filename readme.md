LATCH:
1.latches operate based on level triggering
2.latches do not have clock signal
3.latches can be constructed using logic gates
4.latches are sensitive to the input signal only when enabled
5.latches operate at a faster speed
6.latches operate using only binary inputs
7.latches require less power.
8.latches perform asynchronous operations
9.latches are less robust
10.latches require less area

Flip-Flop:
1.filp-flops operate based on edge triggering
2.flip-flops have a clock signal
3.flip-flop can be constructed using latches and a clock
4.filp-flops are sensitive to both the input signal and the clock signal
5.flip-flops operate at a slower speed
6.flip-flops operate using binary input and the clock signal
7.flip-flops require more power
8.flip-flops perform synchronous operations
9.flip-flops are more robust
10.flip-flops require more area
